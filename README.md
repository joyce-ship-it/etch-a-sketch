The last goal of this project: darkening the square took me some time to understand opacity and how the opacity value(event.target.style.opacity) is an empty string by default. By making the container black and the square divs white, and decreasing the opacity by 0.1 with each mouseover event that leads to the background becoming more prominent and the foreground fading away thanks to the reduced opacity, this goal was accomplished

The width of each div was calculated by using the dimensions input by the user. Thanks to the TOP discord community for the support.
